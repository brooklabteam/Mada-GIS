# Mada-GIS

This repository contains useful GIS layers (mostly of Madagascar!) for various Brooklab projects and provides ease-of-access for plotting.

There are 5 main subfolders, which correspond to different layers for Madagascar, from simplest ("0", which is just a national bondary) to most complex ("4", which includes all local fokantany outlines and roads).

This repo is mainly here for the purposes of being able to cross-reference to other projects.
